## About
The framework consists of a composition of existing frameworks on the net.

The idea is to overload at least the components to be able to update as easily as possible and of course as often as possible.

To install it:

``
npm install @axa-fr/react-toolkit-all --save
``

## Behaviours
The framework makes it possible to respect AXA intranet guildlines (behaviors). Notament for example the management of the display of error messages.

For example, a field in error will appear in red only at the exit of the field or if the form has been validated
